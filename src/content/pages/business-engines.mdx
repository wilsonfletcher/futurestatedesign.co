  All successful businesses need momentum. Companies will only build that
  momentum if they keep adding new engines to power growth. In the modern
  economy, most new business engines will be digital.

  The ultimate outcome of most of our work centres on business engines. Every
  new proposition, every new product and every new venture should be thought of
  as a business engine. Anything else is just a vanity project.

Business engines unlock new market opportunities, reach new customers and generate new sources of income. They’re always built on new ideas, and the best enable entirely new customer behaviours: they give them something they didn’t know they needed.

To be worth making (ROI) a new engine has to offer customers something new (a compelling proposition) that they want to buy (distinctive positioning). It needs to be designed cleverly to meet future customer needs (innovative product model). It must be easy for customers to get the most from it (world-class experience). It needs to be built with the simplest and best possible components (proven platforms + new technologies) and run on the right fuel (content, data and business services). Finally, it needs to start first time (launch strategy), accelerate smoothly (growth strategy) and generate plenty of energy returns (a smart business model).

Within each of these building blocks are many smaller elements that need work. Too many good ideas fail to become successful innovations because they don’t get all the moving parts to work together. They fail because of a lack of holistic thinking.

Our business engine model isn’t a rigid set of rules: it’s a way to think about all of the moving parts and what we need them to turn into.

Remember, anything new worth taking to market only has to do one job: build new momentum to move your business forward.
