description: It’s really very simple. If you don’t make your future happen, the future will be done to you. That’s unlikely to go well.

Customer-led, data-informed design should be your go-to method for everything you’re currently doing. Futurestate design is for everything you need to do as well as, or instead of, the things you do today.

To achieve the big leaps forward that unlock real growth, you must activate new behaviours in future customers. If you design for what customers say they want today, you’ll never invent the thing they didn’t know they needed until they have it.

Futurestate design is at the heart of how we think and work, and it’s crucial to the future-making mindset we instil in our clients. It’s both a thinking discipline and a set of practical methods. It’s not speculative, theoretical, future-fantasy: it’s all about using near-future thinking to shape what you do next.
