      big.
    </p>
    <p class="h3">
      We’ve helped some of the world’s leading companies innovate for 20 years.
    </p>
    <p class="h3">
      We now offer all of that experience to startups in a unique advisory and
      coaching programme.

      If you lead an early stage company, we’ll give you the support you need to

    Advisory support can be fluffy. This is the opposite. This is a ‘here’s what you need to do and how to do it’ programme.

    We’ll help you make good decisions, get past obstacles fast, avoid costly mistakes and take valuable shortcuts.

    You’ll get objective inputs, straightforward, practical advice, immediately applicable micro-coaching, and proven methods you can use.

    ### 30 minute chemistry call

    First thing’s first – before you sign up, we do a short call to learn about you and to explain the programme. If everything lines up, we’ll get you signed up and we’ll book in the full prep call.

    <Callout {...callout} class="not-prose" />

    ### Day 1: 1 hr prep call

    We’ll use this call to dig a bit deeper into what you’ll need support with, and prepare for the full day workshop. We’ll send you some questions in advance so you have a chance to prepare.

    ### Week 1: Immersion workshop

    Next comes a full-day workshop with you (remote, or, ideally in-person in our London studios) where we’ll get fully up to speed with the business and your plans, work through any immediate problems, share useful techniques and end up with a plan of attack for the next 3-6 months.

    ### Every 2 weeks

    We run a 1 hr review call to make sure we stay close to what’s going on and can track progress against the plan.

    ### Every 3 months

    The quarterly review is a 2-3 hour session to review and adjust areas of focus for the next 3 months. These can planned in as full-day ‘next step’ workshops at key stages of the business’s development.
