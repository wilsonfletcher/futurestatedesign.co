<p class="h3">Founded as Wilson Fletcher by Mark Wilson and Stephanie Fletcher, we [became **Futurestate Design Co.**] to mark our 20th anniversary.</p>

<p class="h3">The brand change reflects our renewed focus on business innovation, the growing success of our futurestate design methods, our love of bold ideas, and our mission to help every company we can become a successful innovator.</p>

Can we link here to manifesto, Business engines and about Futurestate Design?

Futurestate is also new generation of expert consultancy. To meet the needs of clients with diverse, individual needs, we need to be able to operate without the traditional boundaries and constraints of an agency model.

Our core team of innovation specialists can call on an extensive network of expert practitioners, subject matter experts and partner companies to support almost any need with top-tier people.

Weâ€™ve worked with a lot of great people over the years (and plenty who were not so great) and we only want our clients to work with specialists and partners who we trust to do an exceptional job.

Young or old, big or small, if you want to become a company that innovates like the best, we can help you too.

Network - across mutiple sectors, connected to excellent practitioners and access to funding/VC?
