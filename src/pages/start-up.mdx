A specialist advisory and coaching programme for leaders of growth-stage digital startups.

You’ve started something great.Now you need to become something big.

We’ve helped some of the world’s leading companies innovate for 20 years.

We now offer all of that experience to startups in a unique advisory and coaching programme.

If you lead an early stage company, we’ll give you the support you need to realise your full potential and compete with the world’s best – for a fixed, low monthly fee.

In the words of one of our pilot members:

“Honestly, this programme paid for itself a hundred times over with the decisions we made in the first workshop.”

## How we support you

Advisory support can be fluffy. This is the opposite. This is a ‘here’s what you need to do and how to do it’ programme.

We’ll help you make good decisions, get past obstacles fast, avoid costly mistakes and take valuable shortcuts.

You’ll get objective inputs, straightforward, practical advice, immediately applicable micro-coaching, and proven methods you can use.

## Programme structure

### 30 minute chemistry call

First thing’s first – before you sign up, we do a short call to learn about you and to explain the programme. If everything lines up, we’ll get you signed up and we’ll book in the full prep call.

### Day 1: 1 hr prep call


We’ll use this call to dig a bit deeper into what you’ll need support with, and prepare for the full day workshop. We’ll send you some questions in advance so you have a chance to prepare.

### Week 1: Immersion workshop

Next comes a full-day workshop with you (remote, or, ideally in-person in our London studios) where we’ll get fully up to speed with the business and your plans, work through any immediate problems, share useful techniques and end up with a plan of attack for the next 3-6 months.

### Every 2 weeks

We run a 1 hr review call to make sure we stay close to what’s going on and can track progress against the plan.

### Every 3 months

The quarterly review is a 2-3 hour session to review and adjust areas of focus for the next 3 months. These can planned in as full-day ‘next step’ workshops at key stages of the business’s development.

## Support when you need it

### Ad-hoc interventions

You can then contact us with anything important you need support with when you need it (within reason, obviously). We get you set up on the best messaging platforms for you (Slack is our default) and make sure you have all the email and contact details you need.

### Network and insights

A key part of this programme is our network. We connect you with people who can help your business and your own personal development. We share relevant content and research that we uncover or create – and help you understand what it means for your business.

### Micro-coaching

We provide specific targeted coaching and introduce techniques to help you overcome roadblocks, make key decisions on direction or strategy, or solve key product problems. We can even help you make the right decision on  that key hire you’re planning.

### Project support

If you need more intensive support to get something done, we can step in to help by spinning up a project team, or introducing a partner. Planned and budgeted separately, we can generally get going quickly: we’ll already know you well, so there’s no onboarding time
