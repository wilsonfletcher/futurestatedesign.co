## We work best with

We work best with people who fit a few basic criteria. If you recognise yourself here, we’ll get on just fine.

- Forward-thinking senior leaders who genuinely want to build a business fit for the future
- Leaders of critical initiatives who want to do everything possible to make them a success
- Open-minded business leaders who want to be challenged to think differently, explore new perspectives and inject new ideas
  vAuthentic, genuine humans who want to work with authentic, genuine humans – and enjoy the process
- You’re in an established company who wants to become or remain a market leader and is committed to innovation-driven growth
- Or, you’re in a young company who needs to grow from having a great product to become world-class digital business
- You probably have plenty of expertise and in-house skills but you want expert support to complement or supplement what you have
