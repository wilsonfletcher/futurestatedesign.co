        <p class="intro">
          All successful businesses need momentum. Companies will only build
          that momentum if they keep adding new engines to power growth. In the
          modern economy, most new business engines will be digital.
        </p>
        <div class="prose">
          <p class="lead">
            The ultimate outcome of most of our work centres on business
            engines. Every new proposition, every new product and every new
            venture should be thought of as a business engine. Anything else is
            just a vanity project.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Business engines unlock new market opportunities, reach new
            customers and generate new sources of income. They’re always built
            on new ideas, and the best enable entirely new customer behaviours:
            they give them something they didn’t know they needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be worth making (ROI) a new engine has to offer customers
            something new (a compelling proposition) that they want to buy
            (distinctive positioning). It needs to be designed cleverly to meet
            future customer needs (innovative product model). It must be easy
            for customers to get the most from it (world-class experience). It
            needs to be built with the simplest and best possible components
            (proven platforms + new technologies) and run on the right fuel
            (content, data and business services). Finally, it needs to start
            first time (launch strategy), accelerate smoothly (growth strategy)
            and generate plenty of energy returns (a smart business model).
          </p>
          <p>
            Within each of these building blocks are many smaller elements that
            need work. Too many good ideas fail to become successful innovations
            because they don’t get all the moving parts to work together. They
            fail because of a lack of holistic thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our business engine model isn’t a rigid set of rules: it’s a way to
            think about all of the moving parts and what we need them to turn
            into.
