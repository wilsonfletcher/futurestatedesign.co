    ### What’s involved?

    Mapping customer journeys and service flows successfully requires a combination of futurestate design, team workshops, customer, stakeholder and desk research, business analysis, information design and journey visualisation.

    ### How long does it take?

    They can run over anything from a couple of weeks to a few months, depending on the scope and scale of the challenge and what internal resources you have available. Most take 6-8 weeks with a blended team.

    ### The end result

    You’ll be able to see how a customer should move through all of the key touch-points of your service, across the full customer lifecycle, and how to align each point with commercial objectives, support interventions, business processes, product experiences, technology integrations and more.

    ### The business outcomes

    The outputs are detailed visualisations of the entire service experience, often as large-format posters and/or interactive working tools – incredibly valuable business tools that enable you to optimise initiatives and investments and unite efforts behind achieving the best possible experience for customers and the business alike.

<Section name="The futurestate approach">
  <Prose>
    <p class="lead">We always start with your futurestate – what you should do, not what you do now – to envision what the ideal target journey should be. We then map today’s experience against it to identify gaps – or more often – between now and the futurestate, and what is needed to bridge them.</p>
    <p class="h3">Some of the key benefits of our approach:</p>

    - Overcomes constraints of designing solely from current data and customer feedback ‘echo chambers’
    - Uncovers opportunities for big leaps forward in performance and, frequently, radical new approaches to legacy processes
    - Makes the ideal target visible to everyone, in a format that your organisation can get the most long-term value from
    - Ties all key business drivers, external services and customer goals into one coherent picture
    - Ensures all activities are future-focused, eliminating unnecessary spend on things that don’t contribute to the ideal target
