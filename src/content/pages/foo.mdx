## Syntax highlighting

We also support syntax highlighting in MDX out-of-the-box! This example uses our default [Shiki theme](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki). See the [MDX integration docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/#syntax-highlighting) for configuration options.

```astro

const weSupportAstro = true;

<h1>Hey, what theme is that? Looks nice!</h1>

## Tasklist

- [ ] to do
- [x] done

The point can be illustrated by comparing a sample of AsciiDoc with an equivalent sample of Markdown. Here is a sample of AsciiDoc from the AsciiDoc manual:

1. List item one.

- List item one continued with a second paragraph followed by an
  Indented block.
- .................
  $ ls _.sh
  $ mv _.sh ~/tmp
  .................
- List item continued with a third paragraph.

2. List item two continued with an open block.

---

This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.

a. This list is nested and does not require explicit item
continuation.

- This paragraph is part of the preceding list item.

b. List item b.

## This paragraph belongs to item two of the outer list.
