<p class="lead">Design and visualise your optimal future customer journey – and understand what you need to make it happen.</p>

## How it works

### What’s involved?

Mapping customer journeys and service flows successfully requires a combination of futurestate design, team workshops, customer, stakeholder and desk research, business analysis, information design and journey visualisation.

### How long does it take?

They can run over anything from a couple of weeks to a few months, depending on the scope and scale of the challenge and what internal resources you have available. Most take 6-8 weeks with a blended team.

### The end result

You’ll be able to see how a customer should move through all of the key touch-points of your service, across the full customer lifecycle, and how to align each point with commercial objectives, support interventions, business processes, product experiences, technology integrations and more.

### The business outcomes

The outputs are detailed visualisations of the entire service experience, often as large-format posters and/or interactive working tools –  incredibly valuable business tools that enable you to optimise initiatives and investments and unite efforts behind achieving the best possible experience for customers and the business alike.

## The futurestate approach

We always start with your futurestate – what you should do, not what you do now – to envision what the ideal target journey should be. We then map today’s experience against it to identify gaps – or more often  – between now and the futurestate, and what is needed to bridge them.

Some of the key benefits of our approach:

- Overcomes constraints of designing solely from current data and customer feedback ‘echo chambers’
- Uncovers opportunities for big leaps forward in performance and, frequently, radical new approaches to legacy processes
- Makes the ideal target visible to everyone, in a format that your organisation can get the most long-term value from
- Ties all key business drivers, external services and customer goals into one coherent picture
- Ensures all activities are future-focused, eliminating unnecessary spend on things that don’t contribute to the ideal target
